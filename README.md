# Earthworm-Tracking-Using-YOLOv7
This project is based on detection,segmentation and tracking of earthworms in a video using YOLOV7. each frame consists of 4 earthworms and our purpose was to detect, segment and track each one of them through out the video. the tracked data from the video should be save in a csv file that can be used for soil analysis or pestisides testing in ecological field.
we have also developed a GUI for user for finding different parameters like speed, distance covered, total distance, fractal dimension and entropy of each earthworm.
Tkinter library is used for the GUI.
dataset consists of 7000 images that is prepared and annotated manually.
